<h2 id="idling">Idling</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em><strong>What is considered idling?</strong></em><br>
Idling is when your vehicle engine is on, but the car is not moving. (This can be at traffic lights, parking lots, Drive Thru’s, etc.) Some cases of idling are avoidable (for example waiting to pick up someone and leaving the car running) and some are not (e.g. stopped at a stoplight for 3 seconds). While idling, the engine still burns fuel (which leads to emissions and wasted money).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>After being stopped for how long should I turn off my engine?</strong></em><br>
A good rule of thumb is to turn off your car if you’re going to be stopped for more than <strong>60 seconds</strong>. After idling for 10 seconds, the same amount of fuel (or more) is burned compared to doing an engine restart! We say 60 seconds because the cost of the amount of fuel wasted should offset any maintenance costs due to engine wear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Why does it matter how much I idle?</strong></em><br>
Engines still burn fuel while idling, leading to: emissions of greenhouse gases, wasted fuel, and increased mileage (even when you aren’t moving!). It hurts the environment, wastes fuel, and increases possible maintenance costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>How can I reduce my idling?</strong></em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The easiest thing to do is be more aware of when you are idling and Switch Off your engine (see #2).</li>
<li>You can also plan your route to avoid places of heavy traffic, which might help you get to your destination faster!</li>
<li>We are currently working on implementing an <em>idle heat map</em> feature that lets you know where the idling hotspots are- so you can avoid them and the traffic along with it!</li>
<li>Attaching a block heater to your car to warm the engine block can also reduce emissions and decrease the amount of time the engine takes to reach operating temperatures (if it’s cold out).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><em><strong>What are some of the factors that are taken into calculation?</strong></em><br>
The time spent idling, engine size, and fuel type, are the main factors used to tell how much fuel is wasted and the emissions that come from combustion. The fuel economy of your car is used to determine the equivalent ‘extra mileage’ that your car traveled while idling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>How big of an impact does idling make?</strong></em><br>
Here’s a stat from <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/communities-infrastructure/transportation/idling/4463">NRCAN</a>: if the average Canadian driver avoids idling for just <strong>three minutes</strong> a day for  a year, around <strong>1.4 million tonnes of CO2</strong> and <strong>630 million litres of fuel</strong> would be saved. That’s a huge impact from just three minutes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Where do you get all of your information from?</strong></em><br>
See <a href="#resources">Resources</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p><em><strong>How can I find my vehicle’s engine capacity and fuel consumption/economy?</strong></em><br>
Doing a quick search of your vehicle model and year will help you find these details. If you have access to your vehicle manual, the information can also be found there. You will have to know basic details about your car to select the correct one, but the more you know the better!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>What kind of information does the app give me?</strong></em><br>
The app shows you a daily, monthly, and all-time view of how you have been idling. This includes time spent idling, estimated fuel losses, gas emissions (CO2, NOx, THC, CO), and mileage incurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Is the app free?</strong></em><br>
Free to download, free to use. Isn’t that great?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Do I have to buy a physical device to attach to my car?</strong></em><br>
No, we designed it so that anyone with a car and mobile device can use the app and learn about their impact. However, for those who do have an OBDII or equivalent, we are working on using that data to remove the trip review process. This would be completely optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>How is my data protected?</strong></em><br>
Our data has standard protection measures put into place, including password hashing for your password (so no one can ever access it). We also don’t share personal information- <em>read our <a href="https://www.switchoffapp.com/switchoff_privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information on your data.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>What kind of car do I need to be able to use the app?</strong></em><br>
The app is for non-electric vehicles.</p>
